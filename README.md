# STACKD - Full-Stack Scaffolding Tool

STACKD (Abbreviation TBD) is an open-source scaffolding tool that simplifies the process of setting up a full-stack web application. It allows developers to generate a project with pre-configured frontend, backend, database, authentication, and other essential components in just a few clicks.

## üí° Motivation

We got the motive to build this application because every time me and my team went for a hackathon, it used to take a lot of time to set up the project with basic things like frontend, UI setup, backend, ORM connection, authentication, and other configurations. People in the work environment also struggle with this, so we came up with this idea. STACKD allows programmers to jump directly into coding instead of spending time on tedious setup tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- **Flexible Project Setup**: Choose from multiple frontend, backend, database, and authentication options.
- **Automated Configuration**: Generates all necessary files, environment variables, and configurations.
- **Git Integration**: Initializes a Git repository and sets up the remote origin.
- **Pre-configured ORM & Database**: Automatically connects the chosen ORM with the selected database.
- **Instant Deployment Readiness**: Sets up authentication, UI frameworks, and other dependencies for a fully functional project.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: STACKD provides both a **CLI** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy project setup.
